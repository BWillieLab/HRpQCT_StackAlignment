# HR-pQCT double-stack scan alignment using IPL

---
## Overview

This package performs batch processing in **IPL (Image Processing Language)** for **Scanco Medical** imaging datasets.  
It is specifically designed to align double-stack scans *with no overlap* between the stacks, correcting rotational misalignments around the *z-axis* and translations in the *x-y* plane.

## Functionality

### This package:
- **Aligns** stacks of a double-stack scan for:
  - Rotational misalignment (around the *z-axis*)
  - Translational misalignment (*x-y* plane)
  - Creates a log file of the analysis in the folder of each scan

---

## Usage
> üí° This package assumes that the standard evaluation has already been completed, such that the trabecular and cortical
> masks and GOBJs, as well as grayscale and segmented files are available

**STEP 1:** Download the scripts *0_STACK_ALINGMENT_BATCH.COM*, *1_STACK_ALINGMENT_QUE.COM*, and *2_STACK_ALINGMENT_IPL_V1.COM* on your local computer.

**STEP 2:** Using a text editor (e.g., notepad), open script *0_STACK_ALINGMENT_BATCH.COM*, then list all scans, for which
the alignment is needed, as follows:

> üí° The input AIM files need to be entered with their full directory.
> Also, make sure to change the scanner USER to proper name in the examples shown below

```bash
@1_STACK_ALINGMENT_QUE.COM   DK0:[USER.DATA.00000001.00000001]C0000001.AIM
@1_STACK_ALINGMENT_QUE.COM   DK0:[USER.DATA.00000002.00000002]C0000002.AIM
...
```
Where:
- `c0000001.aim` is your grayscale `.AIM` file from the double-stack scan.

**STEP 3:** Transfer the scripts to the login directory of the scanner using an FTP transfer software such as filezilla

> üí° Make sure the scripts are transferred in ASCII mode

**STEP 4:** Open a DECterm window, then run the batch script, as follows:
```bash
@0_STACK_ALINGMENT_BATCH.COM
```

This will submit all the stack alignment jobs to the FAST queue.


> üí° To run the stack alignment in interactive mode for a scan at a time,
> submit the job using this command: @2_STACK_ALINGMENT_IPL_V1.COM   DK0:[USER.DATA.00000001.00000001]C0000001.AIM

## Inputs
- Grayscale `.AIM` file of the potentially misaligned double-stack scan

---

## Outputs
- Transformation matrix used for alignment
- Pseudo-volumes of adjacent stack slices *(see referenced paper for details)*
- Aligned grayscale and segmented images
- Aligned trabecular and cortical masks, and corresponding GOBJs
- Log file of the analysis in the folder of each scan
